#Sound & Space (Spring 2020)
Prof: Martin Lawless 

Language: MATLAB

Course Description:
Fundamentals of acoustics, including sound waves, room and hall acoustics, and metrics of sound. Audio engineering, including microphones, 
signal processors, amplifiers and loudspeakers. Applications of psychoacoustics including virtual acoustic environments over headphones and
loudspeakers.

Personal Comments:
In this class I learned how to properly format my figures to make them look nice. I also gained experience in properly commenting functions so the description shows up in the 'help' command, and how to use nargin for more robust function inputs.
